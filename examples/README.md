# examples

A collection of examples showcasing how to use the library.

To compile, navigate to each subfolder and run

```bash
cmake . && make
```

Each folder contains a CMakeLists that is configured to compile with the flags -Wall and -std=c99.

If you are under Windows, I'd suggest you add all source files in a Visual Studio project.
